# Shader Sandbox

Sandbox repo to test various shaders. Using three.js for live web shader demos, and potentially OpenFrameworks later on to test on other platforms like raspberry pi.

### Testing out Web FrameWork

From threejs documentation.

### Node.js server
Node.js has a simple HTTP server package. To install:

npm install http-server -g
To run (from your local directory):

http-server . -p 8000


### Python server
If you have Python installed, it should be enough to run this from a command line (from your working directory):
```
//Python 2.x
python -m SimpleHTTPServer

//Python 3.x
python -m http.server
```
